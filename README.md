# [Ball Game](http://drknotter.github.io/ball-game)

This is a small game that I developed. The object of the game is to maneuver the white ball (using the wasd keys) into the other balls so they land into their appropriately colored wells. Once a ball is in the correct well, a timer counts up... forever. That's as far as I got.
